  * radio record, when reach max record length does not resume playout, nor switch back to live is working. Had to tun off/on to restore. Maybe trying another station without on/off would work ?
  * radio record does not work with mms://
  * re-implement podcast with similar mechanism as radio player. This will allow to pause/back/forward/resume ?
  * add 'Euro' sign to title monitor and replace it by 'E'
  * add title to radio buff, in order to show relevant title even when radio is paused/resumed
